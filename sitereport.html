			<h1>My experience of learning web development </h1>
			<p>
				 Before i joined NAMI college I didn’t know about much about HTML and CSS. So this was like an window of opportunity for me to learn something new that I hadn’t learned before. I did some research before the very first day of my class but still it was very complex as learning ABC fro the first time, but it was interesting experience at the same time.As a beginner it was Very challenging. After even knowing the basic concepts i still didn’t know where and how to apply them. After all those problems and difficulties i faced before joining this course now i can feel that I’ve gained a bit more knowledge then the beginning. Though this was bare minimum needed for web development.This assignment has helped me a lot to learn many things and how HTML and CSS works to create a website. This course was very helpful to me. I didn’t know any of these things existed before but now i am delighted that i took this course and learned a lot of things. I can clearly see changes within myself, thanks to our module lecturer. And i am looking forward to learn many more topics and codes.

			<h1>Report on designs used in websites</h1>
			<p>
				This is my very first experience to come about a website. My website consists of five html pages i.e. (index, portfolio, contact, blog, Sitereport)
I’ve made one css for every pages. Every of the pages are responsive designed.
In the home page, I’ve used background image. Those background images are used by my own choice. There’s my name in home page. The next page is portfolio page . In this page i have used grid layout for column and three placeholder images are inserted inside the column. Background image is also placed in portfolio page. And the next page is contact page. My contact information is included in this page. Next is blog page. In the blog page i have explained in brief about before starting assignment and during phase and the submission. I’ve used column grids.
And this is sitereport this page describes in brief about my module learning experience, reference of tags and images for website I’ve used.

			<h1>Module learning experience</h1>
			<p>
Talking about this module. I find it more fascinating and amusing. Every lecture slides has described each and every topics very understandably. Due to module lecturer friendly and polite deportment it has been very much uncomplicated to interact with lecturer and crystal clear all our doubts and confusion. The exercises which were provided in the slides also helped alot to develop skills.
